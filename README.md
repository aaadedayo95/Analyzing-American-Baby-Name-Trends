# Analyzing-American-Baby-Name-Trends

## Project Description

In this project, we explore the changes in American baby name preferences since 1920. We analyze which names have remained popular for over 100 years and compare them to more recent top baby names. Through this analysis, we gain insights into trends and popularity, valuable skills applicable not only to new parents but also to businesses seeking to understand consumer preferences. The dataset, provided by the United States Social Security Administration, includes first names and the number of babies of each sex who were given those names each year. Focusing on names given to over 5,000 American babies in a year, our data spans 101 years, from 1920 to 2020.
